        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is it. Welcome, to that which you have always craved, 
            but never known. Plato once said,
            he who goes to the cave that is Mc-donalds,
            is looking for the idea that is Langos. 
            A great many people have reached Nirvana just thinking
            about this. Just as many have died eating it.
            Enjoy.
